### Subscale driver

1. Altitude like Anil wants?
2. Handle blast charge 7g's
3. Change command-line arg names to be event-oriented instead of action-oriented
4. Make landing g force not get detected till delay elapsed since main deployment (like for main deployment has a delay/cooldown since takeoff) or use altitude instead
